Reference
=========

This is a small reference documentation list for further learning and
studying.

I believe the following list is also applicable to Elixir programmers as
well as Erlang/OTP programmers. While Erlang/OTP books and
documentations are focusing onto rather low-level implementations,
Elixir programmers also have to know the details if they want to fully
utilize the functionality of Erlang/OTP and BEAM [#ref1]_.

I will not quote `the books listed in the Erlang/OTP manual
<http://erlang.org/doc/index.html>`_. They are all essential. Read them
first if you haven't.

The following blogs and small books will help you **a lot** (and even
worth paying for):

* `Fréd Hebert's blog <http://ferd.ca/>`_
* `Loïc Hoguin's blog at Nine Nines <https://ninenines.eu/articles/>`_
* `Jesper Louis Andersen at Medium <https://medium.com/@jlouis666>`_
* `Brujo Benavides at Medium <https://medium.com/@elbrujohalcon>`_
* Fréd Hebert's free ebook: `Erlang in Anger <https://www.erlang-in-anger.com/>`_
* Loïc Hoguin's excellent ebook product: `The Erlanger Playbook
  <https://ninenines.eu/articles/erlanger-playbook/>`_

I've listed all my Erlang-related article references under `my Diigo
bookmarks with erlang tag
<https://www.diigo.com/profile/jj1bdx?query=%23erlang>`_. `The Diigo
bookmarks with elixirlang tag
<https://www.diigo.com/profile/jj1bdx?query=%23elixirlang>`_ will also
be useful.

`You can find a Japanese version of preliminary document about writing a new Erlang/OTP module for beginners here in Qiita <http://qiita.com/jj1bdx/items/fd42dfb18eb945c9f147>`_.

.. Rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#ref1] I believe Erlang/OTP programmers should learn all about
           Elixir language too, because many useful Web applications are
           written in Elixir, and the ecosystem including Plug and
           Phoenix are now widely used in the real-world production
           systems. A good starting point is here:
