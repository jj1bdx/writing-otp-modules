Erlang/OTP needs your help
##########################

`Erlang/OTP <http://www.erlang.org/>`_ is a well-designed and highly
stable product. Most of the features are carefully designed and easy to
use. Reading the `OTP online manual <http://www.erlang.org/doc/>`_ will
solve most of the problems you will encounter. (If you haven't, you
should do it now.) Erlang/OTP is well maintained by the **OTP Team**.

Unfortunately, even for such a great product, you might find *numerous*
bugs. Sometimes those bugs are nasty enough to prevent writing further
code, or may result in a serious vulnerability or a security hole.
Those bugs *must be reported first to the OTP Team*, even if you cannot
fix them. Erlang/OTP uses the Atlassian JIRA system for `the bug
reporting site <https://bugs.erlang.org/>`_ [#intro1]_ .

Also, OTP team has been chronically understaffed, so their bug fixing
resources are limited. Lots of other people are helping the OTP team,
such as Erlang Solutions, Industrial Erlang User's Group, and the
committers of the `OTP GitHub Repository
<https://github.com/erlang/otp/>`_. Many people from the `Elixir
language <https://elixir-lang.org/>`_ also help a lot.
