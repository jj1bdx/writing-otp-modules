Communication with the OTP Team maintainers
===========================================

Message channels with the OTP Team maintainers
----------------------------------------------

OTP Team assigns a pull request (PR) to a team member as a
maintainer. Close and frequent communication with the maintainer is a
key for contributing good and high quality code. Many levels of
communication may happen, as in the following list:

* GitHub issues (on the PR), for open and public exchange of ideas,
  soliciting broader participation from the community;
* Direct email exchange, mainly for the unofficial exchange of
  conceptual ideas and making private communication and decision; and
* Other informal channels such as face-to-face meeting in a conference,
  which is rare but important to find out the gut feelings of each other
  on various issues.

Respect OTP Team working hours
------------------------------

Most of OTP Team maintainers seem to work in the Sweden time zone, which
is the same as `Central European Time Zone
<https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cet>`_ as observed in many other
nations and regions in Europe.

In the Central European Time Zone, CET, the standard time in the Winter
is UTC + 1 hour. Central European Summer Time (CEST), which is observed
during the summer, is UTC + 2 hours. Note well that the Summer Time or
Daylight Saving Time period *differ between Europe and US/Canada*.

When you send and receive message to OTP Team, you need to respect their
regular working hours. For many of the volunteer contributors including
myself, writing Erlang/OTP code is often *for fun*, but for the OTP Team
it is their *duty and business*. They rarely work in weekends and
holidays [#otpcom1]_. Sending messages will be OK even on their
vacation, but don't expect a prompt reply during non-working hours. And
remember OTP Team members have to handle a lot of different OTP modules
and applications, so their time slot for each application is limited.
